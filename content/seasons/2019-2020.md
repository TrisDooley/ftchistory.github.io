## Game Description
Robots stack 4 by 8 inch yellow giant lego-like cubes on top of a lego-like
baseboard, only controlling a maximum of one at a time. They have to transport
them under a 14" bridge and across the field. At the end of the game they add a
cap to the top of their tower and try to move the tower a couple inches without
it tipping.
